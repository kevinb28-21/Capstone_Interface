Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting

Issue: Changes pushed to GitHub but not deploying to Netlify

Quick Checklist
  ✅ Verify Netlify Site is Connected
  - Go to app.netlify.com
  - Check if your site is listed
  - Verify it's connected to the correct GitHub repository
  ✅ Check Site Status
  - In Netlify dashboard, check if site is paused or active
  - If paused, click "Resume site" or "Activate site"
  ✅ Verify Build Settings
  - Go to: Site settings → Build & deploy → Continuous Deployment
  - Base directory: Should be client (or leave empty if using root netlify.toml)
  - Build command: Should be npm install && npm run build (or npm run build if using netlify.toml)
  - Publish directory: Should be client/dist (or dist if base directory is set to client)
  - Branch to deploy: Should be main (or your default branch)
  ✅ Check Build Logs
  - Go to: Deploys tab in Netlify dashboard
  - Click on the latest deploy
  - Check for build errors or warnings
  - Common issues:
  - Missing dependencies
  - Build command failing
  - Node version mismatch
  ✅ Verify Webhook is Active
  - Go to: Site settings → Build & deploy → Continuous Deployment
  - Click Edit settings next to your GitHub connection
  - Verify webhook is active and receiving events
  - You can test by clicking Trigger deploy
  ✅ Check Branch Configuration
  - Go to: Site settings → Build & deploy → Branch deploys
  - Ensure main branch is set to Production branch
  - Check if branch filtering is enabled (might block deployments)
  ✅ Verify netlify.toml Location
  - The netlify.toml should be in the root of your repository
  - Netlify reads this file automatically
  - Current config uses base = "client" which is correct
  ✅ Check Environment Variables
  - Go to: Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment
  - Verify NODEVERSION = "20" is set (or matches netlify.toml)
  - Check if any required env vars are missing

Common Fixes

Fix 1: Trigger Manual Deploy
  Go to Deploys tab
  Click Trigger deploy → Deploy site
  This will force a new deployment

Fix 2: Reconnect GitHub Repository
  Go to: Site settings → Build & deploy → Continuous Deployment
  Click Edit settings next to GitHub connection
  Click Disconnect then Connect to Git provider
  Re-authenticate and select your repository
  Verify build settings match netlify.toml

Fix 3: Clear Build Cache
  Go to: Deploys tab
  Click on a failed deploy
  Click Clear cache and retry deploy

Fix 4: Verify netlify.toml Syntax
Your current netlify.toml should be:
[build]
  base = "client"
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

If build settings in dashboard differ, they override netlify.toml. Either:
  - Option A: Remove dashboard settings and rely on netlify.toml
  - Option B: Update dashboard to match netlify.toml

Fix 5: Check for Build Errors
Common build errors:
  - Missing dependencies: Add to package.json
  - Node version: Set NODEVERSION = "20" in environment variables
  - Build timeout: Increase in site settings (if on paid plan)
  - Memory issues: Check build logs for OOM errors

Verification Steps
  Check Recent Commits
      git log --oneline -5
      Verify commits are on the branch Netlify is watching
  Test Build Locally
      cd client
   npm install
   npm run build
      If this fails, Netlify build will also fail
  Check Netlify Status Page
  - Visit status.netlify.com
  - Check for any ongoing incidents
  Verify GitHub Webhook
  - Go to your GitHub repository
  - Settings → Webhooks
  - Find Netlify webhook
  - Check recent deliveries for errors

Quick Diagnostic Commands

Check if netlify.toml is valid
cd /path/to/project
cat netlify.toml

Test build locally
cd client
npm install
npm run build

Check if dist folder is created
ls -la client/dist

Still Not Working?
  Check Netlify Support
  - Go to Netlify dashboard → Help → Support
  - Check build logs for specific error messages
  Verify Repository Access
  - Ensure Netlify has access to your GitHub repository
  - Check if repository is private (might need Netlify Pro)
  Check Branch Protection
  - If using branch protection rules, ensure Netlify can push/merge
  Review Build Logs
  - Look for specific error messages
  - Common patterns:
  - Command failed with exit code 1
  - Module not found
  - Permission denied
  - Build timeout

Expected Behavior

When working correctly:
  - Every push to main branch triggers a deploy
  - Netlify shows "Building" status
  - Build completes in 1-3 minutes
  - Site updates automatically
  - You receive email notifications (if enabled)

Next Steps
  Check Netlify dashboard for specific error messages
  Review build logs for the latest deploy
  Verify all settings match this guide
  Try triggering a manual deploy
  If still failing, share the specific error from build logs
