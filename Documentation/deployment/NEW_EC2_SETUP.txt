New EC2 Instance Setup - Quick Guide

Your New EC2 Instance
  - Instance ID: i-0e34df16386b7de35
  - Hostname: ec2-18-117-90-212.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
  - IP Address: 18.117.90.212
  - Key File: ~/Downloads/MS04ID.pem

Quick Setup (Recommended)

Run this from your local machine:

cd ~/Desktop/Projects/CapstoneInterface
bash deploy/run-setup-on-new-ec2.sh

This will:
  ✅ Test SSH connection
  ✅ Transfer setup script to EC2
  ✅ Run complete automated setup
  ✅ Install all dependencies
  ✅ Setup database
  ✅ Configure and start all services
  ✅ Verify everything works

Time: 5-10 minutes

Manual Setup (If automated fails)

Step 1: SSH into EC2
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/MS04ID.pem
ssh -i ~/Downloads/MS04ID.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-117-90-212.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Step 2: Run Setup Script
Once connected to EC2:
Clone repository (if needed)
git clone https://github.com/kevinb28-21/CapstoneInterface.git
cd CapstoneInterface

Make setup script executable
chmod +x deploy/setup-new-ec2.sh

Run setup
bash deploy/setup-new-ec2.sh

What Gets Installed
  - ✅ Node.js 20.x
  - ✅ Python 3 with venv
  - ✅ PostgreSQL
  - ✅ PM2 (process manager)
  - ✅ Nginx (reverse proxy)
  - ✅ Git
  - ✅ All project dependencies

What Gets Configured
  - ✅ PostgreSQL database (droneanalytics)
  - ✅ Database user with secure password
  - ✅ Database schema and migrations
  - ✅ Node.js backend (port 5050)
  - ✅ Flask API (port 5001)
  - ✅ Background worker
  - ✅ Nginx reverse proxy
  - ✅ PM2 auto-start on boot
  - ✅ Environment files (.env)

Services Running

After setup, these services will be running:
  Node.js Backend - pm2 list shows drone-backend
  Flask API - pm2 list shows flask-api
  Background Worker - pm2 list shows background-worker
  Nginx - sudo systemctl status nginx

Verification

On EC2:
Check PM2 services
pm2 list

Test backend
curl http://localhost:5050/api/health

Test through nginx
curl http://localhost/api/health

Check nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx

From Your Local Machine:
Test backend
curl http://18.117.90.212/api/health

Should return: {"status":"ok","database":"connected",...}

Important Files
  - Database Password: Saved to ~/dbpassword.txt on EC2
  - Server .env: ~/CapstoneInterface/server/.env
  - Python .env: ~/CapstoneInterface/pythonprocessing/.env
  - Nginx Config: /etc/nginx/sites-available/drone-backend

Troubleshooting

If setup fails:
  Check SSH access:
      ssh -i ~/Downloads/MS04ID.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-117-90-212.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
  Check security group:
  - Port 22 (SSH) - from your IP
  - Port 80 (HTTP) - from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
  - Port 5050 - from anywhere (or just your IP)
  - Port 5001 - from anywhere (or just your IP)
  Check logs on EC2:
      pm2 logs
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   
If services don't start:

Restart all PM2 services
pm2 restart all

Check status
pm2 status

View logs
pm2 logs drone-backend
pm2 logs flask-api
pm2 logs background-worker

If database connection fails:

Check PostgreSQL is running
sudo systemctl status postgresql

Check password in .env files
cat ~/CapstoneInterface/server/.env | grep DBPASSWORD
cat ~/dbpassword.txt

After Setup
  ✅ Update Netlify (already done in netlify.toml)
  - Redeploy your Netlify site to apply new redirects
  ✅ Test from Frontend
  - Go to: https://cropview.netlify.app
  - Open Analytics page
  - Upload an image
  - Should work without 502 error!
  ✅ Monitor Services
      ssh -i ~/Downloads/MS04ID.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-117-90-212.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
   pm2 monit
   
Security Notes
  - Database password is saved in ~/dbpassword.txt on EC2
  - Keep your SSH key secure
  - Consider setting up firewall rules
  - For production, use HTTPS/SSL
