Quick Fix for 502 Bad Gateway Error

Problem
When uploading images on the analytics page, you get a 502 Bad Gateway error. This means:
  - Netlify is successfully proxying your request to EC2
  - Nginx on EC2 is receiving the request
  - But the Node.js backend on port 5050 is not running or not responding

Quick Fix (Run from your local machine)

Option 1: Automated Fix Script (Recommended)

cd ~/Desktop/Projects/CapstoneInterface
bash deploy/fix-502-complete.sh

This script will:
  SSH into your EC2 instance
  Check if the backend is running
  Restart the backend with PM2
  Verify it's working
  Restart nginx
  Test everything

Note: Make sure your SSH key is at ~/Downloads/MS04ID.pem. If it's elsewhere, edit the script first.

Option 2: Manual SSH Fix

If the script doesn't work, SSH into EC2 manually:

SSH into EC2
ssh -i ~/Downloads/MS04ID.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-223-169-5.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Once connected, run:
cd ~/CapstoneInterface/server

Check if backend is running
pm2 list

If not running or shows error, restart it:
pm2 delete drone-backend
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
pm2 save

Wait a few seconds
sleep 5

Test if it's working
curl http://localhost:5050/api/health

Restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

Check status
pm2 status
sudo systemctl status nginx

What the Script Does
  Checks PM2 Status - Verifies if the backend process is running
  Checks Port 5050 - Verifies if the backend is listening
  Tests Health Endpoint - Confirms the backend is responding
  Checks Logs - If not working, shows recent error logs
  Verifies .env File - Ensures configuration exists
  Installs Dependencies - If needed
  Restarts Backend - Stops and starts with PM2
  Restarts Nginx - Ensures nginx can connect to backend
  Final Verification - Tests everything end-to-end

Common Issues

Issue 1: Backend Crashed Due to Database Error

Symptoms: Backend starts then immediately crashes

Fix:
Check database is running
sudo systemctl status postgresql

Check database connection in .env
cat ~/CapstoneInterface/server/.env | grep DB

Restart database if needed
sudo systemctl restart postgresql

Issue 2: Missing Environment Variables

Symptoms: Backend fails to start, logs show missing config

Fix:
Edit .env file
nano ~/CapstoneInterface/server/.env

Make sure it has at least:
PORT=5050
DBHOST=localhost
DBNAME=droneanalytics
DBUSER=droneuser
DBPASSWORD=yourpassword

Issue 3: Port Already in Use

Symptoms: Backend can't bind to port 5050

Fix:
Find what's using port 5050
sudo lsof -i :5050

Kill the process if it's not PM2
sudo kill -9 <PID>

Issue 4: PM2 Not Starting on Boot

Symptoms: Backend works after manual start but stops after reboot

Fix:
Enable PM2 startup
pm2 startup systemd -u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu
Run the command it outputs
pm2 save

Verification

After running the fix, verify everything works:
  Check PM2:
      pm2 list
      Should show drone-backend as online
  Test Backend:
      curl http://localhost:5050/api/health
      Should return JSON with status "ok"
  Test Through Nginx:
      curl http://localhost/api/health
      Should return JSON with status "ok"
  Test from External:
      curl http://18.223.169.5/api/health
      Should return JSON with status "ok"
  Test from Browser:
  - Go to: https://cropview.netlify.app
  - Open Analytics page
  - Try uploading an image
  - Should work without 502 error

Still Having Issues?
  Check Backend Logs:
      pm2 logs drone-backend --lines 50
  Check Nginx Logs:
      sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
  Check Nginx Config:
      sudo nginx -t
   sudo cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/drone-backend | grep proxypass
      Should show: proxypass http://localhost:5050;
  Verify File Paths:
      ls -la ~/CapstoneInterface/server/src/server.js
   ls -la ~/CapstoneInterface/server/ecosystem.config.cjs
   
Understanding the Flow
  Browser → Uploads image to /api/images
  Netlify → Proxies /api/ to http://ec2-18-223-169-5.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/
  Nginx on EC2 → Receives request, proxies /api to http://localhost:5050
  Node.js Backend → Handles /api/images, saves to database
  Background Worker → Processes image automatically

The 502 error happens at step 3-4, meaning nginx can't connect to the Node.js backend.
