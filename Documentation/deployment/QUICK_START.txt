Quick Start - EC2 Deployment

Prerequisites
  Your idrsa key file must be accessible
  Your EC2 instance must be running
  Security group must allow SSH (port 22)

Step 1: Locate Your Key File

Your key file should be named idrsa. Common locations:
  - ~/Downloads/idrsa
  - ~/.ssh/idrsa
  - Wherever you downloaded it from AWS

Step 2: Copy Key to Project (Optional but Recommended)

Copy your key file to the project directory
cp /path/to/your/idrsa /Users/kevinbhatt/Desktop/Projects/CapstoneInterface/

Step 3: Run Automated Setup

Option A: If key is in project directory
cd /Users/kevinbhatt/Desktop/Projects/CapstoneInterface
./deploy/auto-setup.sh

Option B: If key is elsewhere
cd /Users/kevinbhatt/Desktop/Projects/CapstoneInterface
./deploy/run-setup.sh
When prompted, enter the full path to your key file

Step 4: After Setup Completes
  SSH into EC2:
      ssh -i idrsa ec2-user@ec2-18-224-7-31.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
  Edit environment files:
      nano ~/CapstoneInterface/server/.env
   # Add your AWS credentials, database password, etc.
   
   nano ~/CapstoneInterface/pythonprocessing/.env
   # Add your AWS credentials, database password, etc.
  Copy PM2 configs:
      cp ~/server-ecosystem.config.js ~/CapstoneInterface/server/ecosystem.config.js
   cp ~/python-ecosystem.config.js ~/CapstoneInterface/pythonprocessing/ecosystem.config.js
   cp ~/python-worker.config.js ~/CapstoneInterface/pythonprocessing/worker.config.js
  Restart services:
      pm2 restart all
   pm2 status
  Check logs:
      pm2 logs
   
Troubleshooting

Key file not found
  - Make sure you've copied idrsa to the project directory
  - Or use run-setup.sh and provide the full path when prompted

Connection refused
  - Check EC2 instance is running
  - Verify security group allows SSH from your IP
  - Check key file permissions: chmod 400 id_rsa

Setup script fails
  - Check EC2 has internet connection
  - Verify you have sufficient disk space
  - Check logs on EC2: ssh in and run pm2 logs
