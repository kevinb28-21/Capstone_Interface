Fixed: "Failed to Fetch" Error

Problem
The application was experiencing "Failed to fetch" errors when making API calls from Netlify to the backend server.

Root Causes Identified
  Mixed Content Error: Netlify redirects were using HTTP instead of HTTPS, causing browsers to block mixed content (HTTPS page trying to load HTTP resources)
  CORS Configuration: Backend server wasn't allowing requests from Netlify domains
  Poor Error Handling: API utility didn't provide helpful error messages for debugging

Fixes Applied
  Fixed Netlify Redirects (netlify.toml)
Changed: HTTP → HTTPS for backend redirects
Before
to = "http://ec2-18-117-90-212.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/:splat"

After
to = "https://ec2-18-117-90-212.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/:splat"

Why: Browsers block mixed content (HTTPS page loading HTTP resources). Using HTTPS ensures secure connections.
  Updated Backend CORS Configuration
Files: server/src/server-enhanced.js, server/src/server.js

Changes:
  - Added automatic Netlify domain detection using regex patterns
  - Allows all *.netlify.app domains (production and preview)
  - More permissive in development mode
  - Better error logging

Code Added:
// Netlify domain patterns (allow all Netlify preview and production domains)
const netlifyPattern = /^https?:\/\/[\w-]+\.netlify\.app$/;
const netlifyPreviewPattern = /^https?:\/\/[\w-]+--[\w-]+\.netlify\.app$/;

// In CORS origin check:
if (netlifyPattern.test(origin) || netlifyPreviewPattern.test(origin)) {
  return callback(null, true);
}
  Improved API Error Handling
File: client/src/utils/api.js

Improvements:
  - Better error messages for connection failures
  - Environment-aware error messages (different for dev vs production)
  - Handles empty responses gracefully
  - Better JSON parsing with fallbacks
  - More detailed error logging

Important: Backend HTTPS Setup

⚠️ Critical: The EC2 backend must support HTTPS for these fixes to work properly.

If Backend Doesn't Have HTTPS:

Option 1: Set up HTTPS on EC2 (Recommended)
  Use Let's Encrypt with Certbot
  Set up nginx reverse proxy with SSL
  Update netlify.toml with the HTTPS URL

Option 2: Use Netlify Functions (Alternative)
  - Create Netlify serverless functions to proxy requests
  - Functions can make HTTP requests to backend
  - More complex but works without backend HTTPS

Option 3: Use Environment Variable (Quick Fix)
  - Set VITEAPIURL in Netlify environment variables
  - Point directly to backend URL (bypasses redirects)
  - Still requires CORS fix on backend

Testing the Fix
  Check Backend HTTPS:
      curl -I https://ec2-18-117-90-212.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/health
      If this fails, backend doesn't have HTTPS yet.
  Test CORS:
      curl -H "Origin: https://your-site.netlify.app" \
        -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
        -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
        -X OPTIONS \
        https://ec2-18-117-90-212.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/health
      Should return CORS headers.
  Check Browser Console:
  - Open DevTools → Network tab
  - Look for failed requests
  - Check error messages (should be more helpful now)

Deployment Steps
  Commit and push changes:
      git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Resolve 'Failed to fetch' errors - HTTPS redirects and CORS"
   git push origin main
  Update Backend (if needed):
  - Deploy updated server files to EC2
  - Restart backend server
  - Verify CORS is working
  Verify Netlify Deployment:
  - Check Netlify dashboard for new deploy
  - Test the application
  - Check browser console for errors

Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Netlify:
  - VITEAPIURL (optional, if you want to bypass redirects)

Make sure these are set in Backend (EC2):
  - ORIGIN - Should include your Netlify domain (optional now, since we auto-allow Netlify)

Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
  Browser console for errors
  Backend logs for CORS warnings
  Netlify function logs (if using functions)
  Network tab in DevTools

Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
  Revert netlify.toml to HTTP (if backend doesn't support HTTPS)
  Set VITEAPIURL environment variable in Netlify
  Update backend CORS to explicitly allow your Netlify domain

Next Steps
  ✅ Fixed netlify.toml redirects (HTTPS)
  ✅ Updated backend CORS (auto-allow Netlify)
  ✅ Improved API error handling
  ⚠️ Verify backend supports HTTPS (if not, set up SSL certificate)
  ⚠️ Test in production after deployment
