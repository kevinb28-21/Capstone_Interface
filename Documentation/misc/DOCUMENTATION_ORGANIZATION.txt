Documentation Organization

This document describes how the project documentation is organized and where to find specific information.

Documentation Structure

All developer documentation has been consolidated into the documentation/ folder following best practices:

File Organization Rules

Moved Files

All documentation files have been moved from root and subdirectories into documentation/:

From Root:
  - DEPLOYMENTGUIDE.md → documentation/deployment/README.md
  - NETLIFYDEPLOYMENT.md → documentation/deployment/NETLIFY.md
  - NETLIFYQUICKSTART.md → documentation/deployment/NETLIFYQUICKSTART.md
  - EC2BACKENDSETUP.md → documentation/deployment/EC2.md
  - QUICKDEPLOY.md → documentation/deployment/QUICKDEPLOY.md
  - S3SETUP.md → documentation/deployment/S3.md
  - S3INTEGRATIONGUIDE.md → documentation/architecture/S3INTEGRATION.md
  - S3IMPLEMENTATIONSUMMARY.md → documentation/architecture/S3IMPLEMENTATION.md
  - BACKGROUNDWORKERIMPLEMENTATION.md → documentation/python-processing/BACKGROUNDWORKER.md

From pythonprocessing/:
  - BACKGROUNDWORKERSETUP.md → documentation/python-processing/BACKGROUNDWORKERSETUP.md
  - ONIONCROPUPDATES.md → documentation/python-processing/ONIONCROP.md
  - documentation/imagecaptureguide.md → documentation/python-processing/IMAGECAPTURE.md

From server/database/:
  - SCHEMAOVERVIEW.md → documentation/database/SCHEMA.md

Kept in Place

These files remain in their original locations:
  - README.md (root) - Main project README
  - pythonprocessing/README.md - Python service quick reference
  - server/database/schema.sql - Database schema SQL file
  - pythonprocessing/databasemigrationaddgndvi.sql - Migration SQL

Documentation Standards

File Naming
  - Use README.md for main index files in each directory
  - Use UPPERCASEWITHUNDERSCORES.md for specific topic files
  - Use descriptive names that indicate content

Structure
  - Each directory has a README.md that serves as an index
  - Related documents are grouped in subdirectories
  - Cross-references use relative paths

Content Standards
  - Clear headings and sections
  - Code examples with syntax highlighting
  - Step-by-step instructions for procedures
  - Cross-references to related documents
  - Table of contents for long documents

Updating Documentation

When adding new documentation:
  Place in appropriate directory
  - Setup guides → getting-started/ or development/
  - API docs → api/
  - Deployment → deployment/
  - Architecture → architecture/
  Update index files
  - Add link to new doc in relevant README.md
  - Update main documentation/README.md if needed
  Follow naming conventions
  - Use descriptive names
  - Follow existing patterns
  Add cross-references
  - Link to related documents
  - Update related docs to link back
