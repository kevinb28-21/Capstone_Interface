UI Transformation Summary

Overview
Transformed the drone crop health monitoring UI to remove all simulation/mock aspects and display real-time image processing analysis, ML model inference, and explainable AI insights. Also implemented the complete ML model training workflow using the TOM2024 dataset.

Changes Made
  Backend Updates

server/src/db-utils.js
  - Enhanced getAllImages(): Now returns complete analysis data including:
  - All NDVI/SAVI/GNDVI statistics (mean, std, min, max)
  - Processing status and timestamps (uploadedat, processedat)
  - ML model details (confidence, modelversion, analysistype)
  - Processed image URLs (processeds3url)
  - Enhanced getImageById(): Same comprehensive data structure
  - Removed mock data: Removed default Toronto coordinates and default geofence from getTelemetry()
  Python Processing Updates

pythonprocessing/preparetom2024data.py (NEW)
  - Maps TOM2024 categories to health categories:
  - Healthyleaf → healthy/veryhealthy (refinable by NDVI)
  - Disease categories → diseased
  - Pest categories → stressed
  - Supports both CATEGORY A (manual split) and CATEGORY B (pre-split)
  - Optional NDVI-based refinement for healthy categories
  - Generates training folder structure matching trainmodel.py expectations

pythonprocessing/backgroundworker.py
  - Automatically detects and uses TensorFlow model if available
  - Extracts and saves ML inference details (confidence, classification, modelversion)
  - Enhanced logging for TensorFlow model usage

pythonprocessing/imageprocessor.py
  - Updated analyzecrophealth() to:
  - Use TensorFlow classification when available
  - Generate healthstatus, healthscore, summary from ML predictions
  - Fallback to NDVI-based classification if TensorFlow not available
  - Include confidence and modelversion in results
  Frontend Components (NEW)

client/src/components/ProcessingStatus.jsx
  - Real-time processing status visualization
  - Progress steps: Uploaded → Calculating NDVI → Calculating SAVI → Calculating GNDVI → Running ML Model → Complete
  - Status indicators with color coding
  - Error message display

client/src/components/VegetationIndexMaps.jsx
  - NDVI/SAVI/GNDVI heatmap visualization
  - Toggle between original image and index maps

client/src/components/MLExplanation.jsx
  - Natural language explanations for ML predictions
  - Feature contribution breakdown (NDVI, SAVI, GNDVI, visual features)
  - Confidence visualization
  - Actionable recommendations based on health status
  - Health status color coding

client/src/components/ModelTraining.jsx
  - Model status display (loaded/not available)

  - Training instructions with code examples
  Frontend Pages Updates

client/src/pages/Home.jsx
  - Removed: Mock/simulation references

  - ProcessingStatus component integration
  - VegetationIndexMaps component for heatmap visualization
  - MLExplanation component for explainable AI
  - Export functionality (JSON)

  - All three vegetation indices prominently displayed

client/src/pages/ML.jsx (COMPLETE REWRITE)
  - Removed: All placeholder text about "mock NDVI calculations"
  - Added:
  - ModelTraining component integration
  - Model performance statistics (total predictions, avg confidence, active models)
  - Predictions by category visualization
  - Recent ML predictions list with confidence scores
  - Selected image analysis with prediction details
  - Feature values display

Data Flow
  Image Upload: User uploads image → Node.js backend saves to database with status 'uploaded'
  Background Processing: Worker picks up image → Calculates NDVI/SAVI/GNDVI → Runs TensorFlow model (if available) → Saves complete analysis
  Frontend Display: UI polls for updates → Shows processing status → Displays all indices → Shows ML predictions with explanations

ML Training Workflow
  Prepare Data:
      python preparetom2024data.py ~/Downloads/TOM2024 ./trainingdata --use-ndvi
  Train Model:
      python trainmodel.py ./trainingdata/train ./models 50
  Deploy: Model saved to ./models/onioncrophealthmodel.h5
  - Background worker automatically detects and uses it
  - No restart needed (checks on each image)
