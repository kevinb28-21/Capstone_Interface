S3 Integration - Implementation Summary

✅ What Has Been Implemented
  S3 Utility Modules
  - server/src/s3-utils.js: Node.js S3 upload utility
  - pythonprocessing/s3utils.py: Python S3 upload utility

Both modules:
  - Upload images to S3 with organized folder structure (images/YYYY/MM/DD/)
  - Generate S3 URLs for stored images
  - Fall back to local storage if S3 is not configured
  - Support signed URLs for private buckets
  Updated Servers

Node.js Server (server/src/server.js)
  - Uploads images to S3 after receiving them
  - Stores S3 URLs in image records
  - Includes s3Url, s3Key, and s3Stored fields in responses
  - Shows S3 status on startup

Flask API (pythonprocessing/flaskapi.py)
  - Uploads images to S3 after processing
  - Uploads processed images (NDVI overlays) to S3
  - Stores S3 URLs in response
  - Maintains backward compatibility with local storage
  Dependencies Installed
  - @aws-sdk/client-s3 (Node.js)
  - @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner (Node.js)
  - boto3 (already in requirements.txt)

📋 What You Need to Provide

Required Information:
  AWS Access Key ID: AKIA...
  AWS Secret Access Key: ...
  AWS Region: (e.g., us-east-1, ca-central-1)
  S3 Bucket Name: (e.g., drone-crop-health-images)

Setup Steps:
  Create S3 Bucket (if needed):
      aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name --region your-region
  Configure Environment Variables:

   server/.env:
      AWSACCESSKEYID=your-access-key-id
   AWSSECRETACCESSKEY=your-secret-access-key
   AWSREGION=us-east-1
   S3BUCKETNAME=your-bucket-name
   
   pythonprocessing/.env:
      AWSACCESSKEYID=your-access-key-id
   AWSSECRETACCESSKEY=your-secret-access-key
   AWSREGION=us-east-1
   S3BUCKETNAME=your-bucket-name
  Set IAM Permissions:
  - Create IAM policy with s3:PutObject, s3:GetObject, s3:ListBucket
  - Attach to your IAM user
  Test:
  - Start servers
  - Upload an image
  - Check S3 bucket for uploaded file
  - Verify response includes s3Url

🔄 Data Flow

Raspberry Pi
    ↓ (captures image + GPS)
Flask API (port 5001)
    ↓ (processes with OpenCV/TensorFlow)
    ↓ (uploads to S3)
Amazon S3 Bucket
    ↓ (stores S3 URL)
PostgreSQL Database (or in-memory store)
    ↓ (serves S3 URL)
Node.js Backend (port 5050)
    ↓ (returns S3 URL)
React Frontend
    ↓ (displays image from S3)

✨ Features
  - Automatic S3 Upload: Images uploaded after processing
  - Organized Storage: Files organized by date (images/2024/11/07/)
  - Fallback Support: Works without S3 (uses local storage)
  - GPS Metadata: GPS data preserved and stored with images
  - Processed Images: NDVI-processed images also uploaded to S3
  - Status Indicators: Server logs show S3 status on startup

🔒 Security
  - Credentials stored in .env files (not committed to git)
  - Supports private buckets with signed URLs
  - IAM-based access control
  - No hardcoded credentials

📝 Next Steps
  Provide AWS credentials (see above)
  Create S3 bucket (if not exists)
  Configure .env files with credentials
  Test upload to verify integration
  Monitor S3 usage in AWS Console

🎯 Current Status

✅ Code Complete: All S3 integration code is implemented  
⏳ Awaiting Configuration: Need AWS credentials and bucket name  
✅ Backward Compatible: Works without S3 (local storage fallback)

Once you provide the AWS credentials and bucket name, the integration will be fully functional!
