Dataset Discovery and Spectral Registry

This document provides a curated shortlist of publicly available datasets for training multi-crop plant health models supporting cherry tomatoes, onions, and corn. Each dataset is documented with spectral band information, resolution, labels, size, license, and download instructions.

Unified Health Taxonomy

All datasets must be mapped to the following unified health schema:

{ veryhealthy, healthy, moderate, poor, verypoor, diseased, stressed, weeds, unknown }

See pythonprocessing/datasets/labelmapping.py for dataset-specific mappings.

Dataset Selection Recommendations

For Initial Training (Minimum Viable Dataset):
  PlantVillage Complete - Provides broad disease coverage across crops
  TOM2024 - Onion-specific pest and disease data
  WeedsGalore - Multispectral corn data with weed annotations

For Production-Grade Model:
  All datasets listed above - Maximum coverage and robustness
  Cherry Tomato (Dryad) - High-quality multispectral data for tomatoes
  Additional UAV datasets - Real-world drone imagery for domain adaptation

For Multispectral-Specific Training:
  Cherry Tomato (Dryad) - RGB+NIR for tomatoes
  WeedsGalore - RGB+RE+NIR for corn
  Supplement with RGB-only datasets - For robustness when NIR unavailable
